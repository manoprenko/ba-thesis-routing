\section*{Abstract}
Modern distributed systems heavily rely on efficient and fault-tolerant networks. Routing algorithms are widely used in computer networks in order to provide consistent and stable packet delivery in the presence of hardware faults.

Most common link state routing algorithms use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute shortest paths and build forwarding tables. This approach provides efficient and reliable routing, but its performance struggles when applied to large scale networks.

This research aims to resolve the performance issue of Dijkstra's algorithm by slightly relaxing the shortest paths requirement. It provides several approaches which increase routing algorithm's performance while avoiding significant loss in the quality of obtained routes.
